## **Behavior Rules**

- Be respectful to other players. No racism, homophobia, sexism, ageism, or excessive toxicity.
- Harassment, doxxing, abuse, slander, hate speech, or discriminatory speech will not be tolerated.
- Racial stereotypes, sexual violence, domestic abuse, suicide, school shootings, slavery, etc. are considered inappropriate and RP, chat, comments, notes, jokes, graffiti, usernames, etc. that are disrespectful or that are about these are prohibited. Use of these terms may result in an automatic ban from the server.
- Actions taken to expressly deny other players the ability to enjoy the community are not allowed (including bullying, stream sniping, and insiding).
- Any player caught harassing or bullying another player on the server or outside of the server, but in relation to their presence on the server will be removed or dealt with accordingly.
- No inappropriate usernames or profile pictures. Usernames referring to sexual acts and genitalia are not allowed. No websites in usernames. Chat and usernames must be in English characters.
- Signs, fireworks, graffiti, etc. must follow Twitch TOS (private and public) and must not be discriminatory or inappropriate. 
- Excessive toxicity towards players and/or staff will not be tolerated and will result in a mute, kick, or ban determined by staff without warning. Discord tickets should be used to communicate behavioral issues. Keep us informed. Behavioral issues will be discussed with all parties involved. Behavior that continues to drive people (players or staff) from the community will result in a mute, kick, or ban as determined by the staff team.

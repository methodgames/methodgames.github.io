## **Gameplay Changes:**

- **Tugboats!**

    - In addition to the two spawn points at each harbor, **you can now purchace tugboats at each of the fishing villages.
        - There are a total of 8 purchase points are available at large fishing village, and 5 purchase points at small fishing village.
    - Once purchased and built, tugboats will be unmountable by other players for 5 minutes.
    - After mounting the drivers seat in the helm, please **remember to hold down e and authorize** on your brand new tugboat!
        - Without authorizing you will not be able to push your tugboat.
    - As a reminder, they will decay in 36 hours and have 3000 health. Whenever you interact with the engine, the decay timer will reset.

## **Rule Changes:**

- **[Added] -** ``Building and Gameplay Rules`` **- Buildings or building blocks that are used to claim land or that are blocking building privilege may be removed at an admin discretion without prior warning. In certain cases, admins may reach out to players to form an understanding of reasonable extents of a build.**
        - We will be testing out this change in an effort to make areas of the map accessible to more players.
        - While we understand your vision may have certain requirements, it is also important to make sure community members do not feel like their opportunities for creativiity are limited.
- **[Added] -** ``Admin Rules`` **- Items spawned in for an admin sponsored event should not be taken. If admin spawned items are found, reach out via a ticket to ensure the return of these items. If spawned in items are taken from an admin, they will be recovered and despawned accordingly.**

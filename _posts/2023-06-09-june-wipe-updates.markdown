## **Rule Changes:**

- **[Added] -** ``Raiding and Looting Rules`` **- Locked boxes within building privilege should not be destroyed.** 
    - If a locked box is within an unsecure area of your base and is destroyed, you will not get the items back. The purpose of this rule is to discourage stealing and to encourage players to secure their loot. Remember, twig is not considered a secure building material.
- **[Added] -** ``Transportation Rules`` **- Do not leave your car on a powered car lift as this will not be considered secure.** 
    - While players should not be damaging or removing locks on cars, you should also not be leaving your locked modular car on a powered car lift. Take measures to ensure that if left on a lift, another player would not be able to use and take the lock off (a reminder that generators can be turned on by any player). Logging off and leaving a car on a publicly accessible powered car lift is considered unsecure and your car and items left in the car will not be returned.

## **Gameplay Changes:**

- Due to changes in how vending machines work this wipe there will not be resource stacking via the admin shop. The test generator swap and cosmetics will still be available.
- A week after wipe a change will be implemented to how stacking works. **Tool cupboards will stack building materials (wood, stone, metal fragments, and high quality metal) up to stacks of 100,000.**
    - Stacks work the same way once in a player's inventory or any other container.
    - They can be split in half by middle clicking and dragging out of the container (onto the ground) or shift + middle click and drag for a third.
- These changes allow admins to shift efforts from this aspect of gameplay and give them more time to focus on being a bigger part of community, planning events, etc.

***The rules are subject to change throughout the wipe if specific aspects need to be clarified or adapted. Not all aspects of gameplay can be detailed in the rules; please use your best judgment and follow the behavior rules.**

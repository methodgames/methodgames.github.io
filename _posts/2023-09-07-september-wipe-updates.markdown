*Last Updated: 9/7/23*

## **Gameplay Changes:**

- **Player Attack Helicopters!**
    - A brand new helicopter has made its way onto the island!
    - This new player attack helicopter can be purchased at the Air Wolf shop at Bandit Camp for 2250 scrap.
    - These vehicles support up to 2 players, a pilot and a gunner. Both the pilot and the gunner can shoot the rockets and the gunner can shoot and aim the gun loaded into the vehicle. You are responsible for securing guns and ammo placed in your player attack helicopter **at all times**.
    - Like other vehicles, they use low grade fuel and have a light.
    - They will decay in 8 hours outdoors, 48 hours indoors, and have 850 health.

- **Parachutes!**
    - Safety first! Parachutes are now available for all island inhabitants. Leap off cliffs, escape ambushes, or simply enjoy the thrill of freefalling before deploying your parachute.
    - Parachutes can be crafted using 2 tarp, 2 sewing kits, and 50 cloth. They will be placed into the new backpack slot.
    - Press space after freefalling (over 15 meters above the ground) to deploy your parachute. You can also hold down space after jumping to deploy it as soon as possible.
    - Parachutes need to be repacked after landing. Please do not shoot at people who have parachutes deployed as they can be damaged and will fall faster with decreased durability.

- **Weapon Racks**
    - Keep your arsenal organized and accessible with weapon racks. These deployable storage units allow you to display and store your firearms and melee weapons efficiently. No more fumbling through your inventory during those intense battles - now you can grab your weapon of choice with ease.
    - You can now mount your weapons for quick access.
    - Be careful with rack placement as they can be picked up by anyone, even without TC authorization. You are responsible for completely securing the items you place on your weapon racks. 

- **Homing Missile Launcher**
    - Rust just got a lot more explosive! The introduction of homing missile launchers adds a deadly new element to combat. Lock onto your target and watch as the missile seeks it out with \*cough\* pinpoint \*cough\* accuracy. While defending your base during purge or launching an assault on the attack helicopter, these new homing missiles can give you an upper hand.
    - The homing missile launcher can be crafted at a tier 2 workbench using 15 high quality metal, 4 metal pipes, 1 tech trash, and 1 CCTV camera.
    - You must lock onto a helicopter (NPC or player owned within PVP) before you can fire.
    - Flares have been given a new life and can now be used as flare ammo in the player attack helicopter as an alternate heat signature to project your vehicle. They can also be thrown from minicopters, scrap helicopters, etc. for the same purpose.
    - Currently, the homing missile launcher cannot be used to target hot air balloons.

- **Hot Air Balloon Armor**
    - Your hot air balloons can now withstand even more punishment. With the new hot air balloon armor upgrades, you can protect your floating transport from enemy fire.
    - To equip the armor, hold down e on the fuel storage and select Equip Armor

## **Rule Changes:**

- **[Added] -** ``Transportation Rules`` **- Vehicle weapons should only be used to target other players within PVP zones.**
    - Added to address the addition of the player attack helicopter and with the oversight of submarines having ammunition.
- **[Added] -** ``Transportation Rules`` **- You are responsible for securing guns and ammo placed in your player attack helicopter **at all times**. This rule is not meant to encourage stealing, but rather to encourage securing your loot. Items may not be returned if misplaced or stolen.**
- **[Changed] -** ``Raiding and Looting Rules`` **- Twig and ladders should not be placed on another player’s base and boosting, flying, parachuting, etc. should not be used to gain access to another player’s base.**
- **[Changed] -** ``PVP / Monument Rules``
    - "Attack Helicopter" has been changed to "Patrol Helicopter" for all instances in the rules.

## **Gameplay Changes:**

- **Frontier Base Decor!**
    - Get ready to revamp your base with the all-new Frontier Base Decor DLC that's part of the latest Rust update. This DLC introduces a captivating old-timey theme that will transport you to a bygone era, infusing your base with a unique and charming ambiance.
    - This DLC introduces a treasure trove of delightful items to enhance your base's aesthetics (including the long awaited rocking chair)!
    - From rustic barrel storage that exudes an air of authenticity to nostalgic wanted posters that whisper tales of the Wild West, and from impressive hunting trophies that celebrate your prowess to fresh and stylish planters that breathe life into your surroundings, you'll have everything you need to craft a base that's truly your own.

- **Rail Network Links!**
    - A Seamless Journey Awaits! The above and below ground rail networks are now linked.
    - Each map will have up to two rail tunnel locations.

- **Oil Rig Radiation!**
    - To tackle the issue of players camping Oil Rigs to prevent the hacked crate from spawning, this update introduces radiation at each of the oil rigs, and a lot of it.
    - After 45 minutes of crate hacking, radiation will kick in, gradually reaching a lethal level of 100 over five minutes.
    - This twist adds a new layer of challenge and strategy to Oil Rig encounters, ensuring a more balanced gameplay experience.

- **Wire Tool Quality of Life - Precision Wiring at Your Fingertips!**
    - Electricians and engineers in Rust have reason to celebrate with the Wire tool's quality-of-life rework. 
    - This update allows for more flexibility in wire placement by saving the current wire configuration when you unequip the tool.
    - Complex wire setups are now easier to manage and place with precision, making Rust's electrical networks more accessible and efficient than ever.

- **Horse Changes - Equip and Ride Your Trusty Steed!**
    - Equipping horses post-update will be slightly different, with the user interface now divided between the four equipment slots and storage.
    - To access your horse's storage, you'll need to hold 'E' while looking at your horse and select the 'loot' option.
    - Saddle bags have been expanded once again, offering a generous 12 slots each. This means you can now store up to 48 items on horseback, although be prepared for a slower ride.

- **Quality of Life (QoL):**
    - As Halloween fades away, the Rust Halloween event is now disabled, marking the end of the spooky season. Halloween town was a blast and we were introduced to so many new survivors!
    - Say goodbye to items mysteriously falling through the bottom of vehicles; this issue has been resolved.
    - Observer Island map is now available on certain Facepunch servers, offering a fresh and exciting gameplay experience.
    - You can now unload ammo from weapons while they are stored in storage boxes, enhancing inventory management.
    - For the green-thumbed survivors, you can now pick up empty planters for a more dynamic base design.
    - The M39 receives an upgrade with the addition of a fourth slot, allowing you to attach a scope, muzzle, laser, and an extended mag for enhanced firepower.

## **Rule Changes:**

- **[Changed] -** ``Raiding and Looting Rules``- If you find a non-decaying base left open or a base that looks like it has been raided, please do not loot it. **Please reach out to an admin to help secure it.** Any items that were lost between the time a base was left open and the time an admin closed or secure it will not be returned. We advise locks be placed on deployables since **locked boxes within building privilege should not be destroyed.** Players that continue to loot non-decaying bases instead of reporting to an admin will be disciplined accordingly. 
    - This change is intended to effectively discourage and put an end to the practice of looting non-decaying bases. Our goal is to promote a stronger sense of community and encourage players to take responsibility for securing and double-checking their bases before logging off. At the same time, it serves as a deterrent, aiming to discourage and take appropriate actions against those who engage in looting.
    - We are advocating the principle of treating others as you would like to be treated.
- **[Added] -** ``PVP Raid Zone Rules`` **- If the train tunnel entrance is located in the PRZ, PVP is only permitted when a player is outside the tunnel entrance and not underneath the tunnel entrance.**
    - This will be to establish a clear boundary for PVP interactions at the train tunnel entrance within the PRZ.


***The rules are subject to change throughout the wipe if specific aspects need to be clarified or adapted. Not all aspects of gameplay can be detailed in the rules; please use your best judgment and follow the behavior rules.**

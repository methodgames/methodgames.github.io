*Last Updated: 11/2/23*

## **Gameplay Changes:**

- **Frontier Building Skin and Base Decor!**
    - Embrace the raw and rugged aesthetic with the new Brutalist building skin for the stone building block. Your base will look tougher than ever before!
    - Items added include storage barrels, wanted posters, hunting trophies, rocking chairs, and many other exciting deployables.


- **Rail Network Links!**
    - A Seamless Journey Awaits! The above and below ground rail networks are now linked.
    - Each map will have up to two rail tunnel locations.

- **Oil Rig Radiation!**
    - To tackle the issue of players camping Oil Rigs to prevent the hacked crate from spawning, this update introduces radiation at each of the oil rigs, and a lot of it.
    - After 45 minutes of crate hacking, radiation will kick in, gradually reaching a lethal level of 100 over five minutes.
    - This twist adds a new layer of challenge and strategy to Oil Rig encounters, ensuring a more balanced gameplay experience.

- **Wire Tool Quality of Life - Precision Wiring at Your Fingertips!**
    - Electricians and engineers in Rust have reason to celebrate with the Wire tool's quality-of-life rework. 
    - This update allows for more flexibility in wire placement by saving the current wire configuration when you unequip the tool.
    - Complex wire setups are now easier to manage and place with precision, making Rust's electrical networks more accessible and efficient than ever.

- **Horse Changes - Equip and Ride Your Trusty Steed!**
    - Equipping horses post-update will be slightly different, with the user interface now divided between the four equipment slots and storage.
    - To access your horse's storage, you'll need to hold 'E' while looking at your horse and select the 'loot' option.
    - Saddle bags have been expanded once again, offering a generous 12 slots each. This means you can now store up to 48 items on horseback, although be prepared for a slower ride.

- **Quality of Life (QoL):**
    - As Halloween fades away, the Rust Halloween event is now disabled, marking the end of the spooky season. Halloween town was a blast and we were introduced to so many new survivors!
    - Say goodbye to items mysteriously falling through the bottom of vehicles; this issue has been resolved.
    - Observer Island map is now available on certain Facepunch servers, offering a fresh and exciting gameplay experience.
    - You can now unload ammo from weapons while they are stored in storage boxes, enhancing inventory management.
    - For the green-thumbed survivors, you can now pick up empty planters for a more dynamic base design.
    - The M39 receives an upgrade with the addition of a fourth slot, allowing you to attach a scope, muzzle, laser, and an extended mag for enhanced firepower.

## **Rule Changes:**

- **[Added] -** ``PVP Raid Zone Rules`` **- If the train tunnel entrance is located in the PRZ, PVP is only permitted when a player is outside the tunnel entrance and not underneath the tunnel entrance.**
    - This will be to establish a clear boundary for PVP interactions at the train tunnel entrance within the PRZ.

***The rules are subject to change throughout the wipe if specific aspects need to be clarified or adapted. Not all aspects of gameplay can be detailed in the rules; please use your best judgment and follow the behavior rules.**

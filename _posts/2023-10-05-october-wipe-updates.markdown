## **Rule Changes:**

- **[Added] -** ``Method Town Center Rules`` **- The Method Town Center (**MTC**) will be a hub for fostering interactive gameplay, aiming to create a rich and interactive setting that accommodates a wide range of role-playing experiences.**
    - To ensure a positive and immersive atmosphere, it's crucial to establish clear rules and guidelines regarding player interactions within the MTC.
        - Protection from PvP and temporary PvP:
            - **No PvP Combat:**
                - Players are not allowed to engage in combat with each other while inside the MTC.
                - This rule promotes a cooperative and roleplay focused environment where players can focus on collaborative gameplay rather than competitive combat.
            - **Airdrop Restrictions:**
                - Player-initiated airdrops are not allowed within the area.
                - Airdrops that spawn naturally in this area are available on a first-come, first-serve basis, offering valuable resources without causing conflicts.
            - **Restrictions on Patrol Helicopter:**
                - Taking down the Patrol Helicopter is not allowed within the MTC.
                - Players who have taken down Patrol Helicopter outside of this area should not target players within this area.
        - Building Rules:
            - Players should not build bases with the intention of using them for PvE or PvP.
            - ~~Due to the limited size of this area, buildings will be restricted to a maximum of 4 square foundations and 6 triangle foundations.~~

***The rules are subject to change throughout the wipe if specific aspects need to be clarified or adapted. Not all aspects of gameplay can be detailed in the rules; please use your best judgment and follow the behavior rules.**

*Last Updated: 12/3/23*

## **Gameplay Changes:**

- **A Decade of Adventure!!**
    - Rust is turning 10 this year and we have a few new party favors to help us celebrate!
    - Pinatas:
        - Craft Pinatas with 500 wood and hang them around your base.
        - Smack them to reduce their health, causing parts to fall off until 2 items drop out upon destruction. These items include goodies like ammo, fuel, food, and tools.
    - Confetti Cannon:
        - Fire off bursts of joy with the Confetti Cannon! Crafted for 75 wood and 5 gunpowder, these cannons can be fired multiple times, showering your celebration with vibrant confetti.

- **Support a Streamer: Spread the Cheer on Twitch!!**
    - Twitch viewers will be rewarded for gifting subscriptions to Rust streamers.
    - From December 7th to December 31st, gift 2 subscriptions to eligible streamers, and receive the Creator Computer Station to deck out your base in style!
    - Subs to [bluejayonmeth](https://www.twitch.tv/bluejayonmeth) will support the Method servers directly as well! \*cough\* *subtle plug* \*cough\*

- **Legacy Items!**
    - Legacy Bow:
        - A blast from the past! The Legacy Bow, with the same stats as the normal hunting bow, now functions as a skin on the item store.
    - Legacy Furnace:
        - Unlock a piece of Rust history by receiving the vintage stone furnace from legacy as a login reward.
        - Play Rust for 3+ hours, and this retro furnace, behaving just like its modern counterpart, will bring a touch of classic legacy aesthetics to your base.
    - M4 Shotgun:
        - Unleash the might of the M4 Shotgun, a powerhouse that outperforms the Spas with increased damage, a slightly slower fire rate, and an extended range.
        - Keep an eye out for this sought-after weapon in higher-end loot crates as it becomes a game-changer in your arsenal.
    - Legacy Shelter:
        - The Legacy Shelter, makes a triumphant return. Costing 600 wood to craft, this ad-hoc shelter can be placed on the fly, featuring a door with a key lock. While normally easy to breach, this shelter offers strategic planning opportunities with ample space for a bag, box, furnace, and bench.

## **Rule Changes:**

- **[Added] -** ``Genearl Rules``- **A ban labeled with the reason “Ban Appeal Via Discord” may be enforced to facilitate a discussion on an ongoing issue. This measure is in place to prevent further damage and to ensure that players thoroughly review the rules. Generally, bans with this designation are promptly lifted following a conversation and acknowledgment of the rules, providing a quick and efficient resolution.**
    - We are putting this in writing :D
- **[Added] -** ``Method Town Center Rules`` **- Due to the limited size of this area, compounds and external TCs are not permitted.**
    - The MTC is a safe area for players to get together and interact with each other.
    - To encourage this behavior, we ask that compounds (that limit interaction) and external TCs (that block where others could build) do not be placed in this area.
- **[Added] -** ``Raiding and Looting Rules`` **- The legacy shelters will be considered building blocks, not deployables, and therefore should not be broken. They should be allowed to fully decay before the contents can be looted.**

***The rules are subject to change throughout the wipe if specific aspects need to be clarified or adapted. Not all aspects of gameplay can be detailed in the rules; please use your best judgment and follow the behavior rules.**

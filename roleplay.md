## About

This inclusive community was created with the vision of facilitating respectful and interactive gameplay. Although respectful roleplay is the primary focus of the server, we have included designated PVP areas, as this is a part of Rust that we would like our players to enjoy. The intent of this design is to allow it to be used as an avenue for players to explore various aspects of gameplay in a safe environment and to use that exposure to exercise their choice of exploring others servers that are more focused on the specific aspects of gameplay they enjoy. 

We are incredibly proud of the wonderful community we have built together. It is a reflection of the kindness and respect you all display in your interactions. It fosters a sense of belonging and friendship among our members and paves the way for creativity to flourish. The support and camaraderie that each one of you brings to this space has truly made it a special place for everyone. The bonds we've formed, the stories we've created, and the adventures we've shared are a testament to the incredible heart of our community.

Thank you for being respectful, creative, and simply amazing.

## Behavior Rules

#### Interactions:
- Be respectful to other players. No racism, homophobia, sexism, ageism, or excessive toxicity.
- Harassment, doxxing, abuse, slander, hate speech, slurs, and discriminatory speech will not be tolerated.

#### Content:
- Slurs, racial stereotypes, sexual violence, domestic abuse, suicide, school shootings, slavery, etc. are considered inappropriate and RP, chat, team chat, comments, jokes, signs, graffiti, usernames, notes, bag names, etc. that are disrespectful or that are about these are prohibited. This applies to both private and public content and interactions. These are all actively monitored and use of these terms, irrespective of duration of existence, may result in an automatic ban from the server.
- No inappropriate usernames or profile pictures. Usernames referring to sexual acts and genitalia are not allowed. No websites in usernames. Chat and usernames must be in English characters.
- Signs, fireworks, graffiti, etc. (both private and public and regardless of duration) must not be discriminatory or inappropriate and must follow Twitch TOS. 
- No excessive or inappropriate chat spam or sounds (via mic, soundboard, etc. and no music).

#### Etiquette:
- Please be mindful that everyone is allowed to focus on aspects of gameplay they enjoy. Your ideas or interests may not coincide, but please be respectful.
- Respect the roleplay and respect those who are not currently looking for an interaction.
- Know your audience. RP, chat, actions, etc. should not make others uncomfortable. If someone is saying or doing something that makes you uncomfortable, please ask them to stop or ask them to avoid that type of interaction with you and let an admin know.

#### Conduct:
- <u><b>Actions taken to expressly deny other players the ability to enjoy the community or gameplay are not allowed.<b><u> This includes bullying, stream sniping, and insiding.
- Any player caught harassing or bullying another player on the server or outside of the server, but in relation to their presence on the server will be removed or dealt with accordingly.
- Excessive toxicity towards players and/or staff will not be tolerated and will result in a mute, kick, or ban determined by staff without warning. Discord tickets should be used to communicate behavioral issues. Keep us informed. Behavioral issues will be discussed with all parties involved. Behavior that continues to drive people (players or staff) from the community will result in a mute, kick, or ban from the server and/or discord as determined by the staff team.
- Please trust that the staff team serves as a valuable resource and mediator with the community's best interests in mind whenever behavioral issues arise. Kindly refrain from directing frustrations at staff members who are genuinely striving to encourage compromise and provide assistance.

## General Rules

#### Combat and Interactions:
- No killing on sight (KOS), random death match (RDM), or griefing (ex. placing traps, authorizing on a TC to deny access, building with the intention of building blocking, etc.)
- No roleplaying (RP) as a killer, thief, bounty hunter, etc. and no using RP as a cover or excuse for killing people.

#### Conflict Resolution:
- <u>If you have a disagreement with another player, please try to roleplay to a solution or respectfully come to a resolution before resorting to a ticket.<u>
- If you are asked to leave someone’s property, please respect their request without hard feelings. Someone may ask you to leave if they are not currently looking to RP.
    
#### Communication and Assistance:
- If you are ever in an uncomfortable situation or fear your items being lost, please take a clip or screenshot of your inventory and/or players in question to make recovery easier.
- Please do not hesitate to contact a staff member regarding any concerns or assistance.
- Please create a ticket If your items are not recoverable due to misconduct of another player.
- Any instance where a loophole in gameplay or in the rules is being exploited will be handled by an admin decision.

#### Account & Ban Policies:
- You will not be allowed to play if you have any accounts with a rust game ban in the last 180 days or >1 rust game ban.
- A ban labeled with the reason "Ban Appeal Via Discord" may be enforced to facilitate a discussion on an ongoing issue. This measure is in place to prevent further damage and to ensure that players thoroughly review the rules. Generally, bans with this designation are promptly lifted following a conversation and acknowledgment of the rules, providing a quick and efficient resolution.
- Use of third-party applications (using the Rust+ protocol) on the server relating to PVP timers or locations are not allowed and will result in an automatic temporary ban for 15 minutes.

**This wipe, there will be a designated PVP and raid zone (which will be referred to as PRZ below), as designated by the yellow outline below.** If your TC authorization range extends into the PRZ, your base will be considered within the PRZ and are subject to <a href="#PVP Raid Zone">PRZ rules</a>. There should be no question of whether your base is on the border of the PRZ.

## Building and Gameplay Rules

#### Construction and Land Use:
- You may not wall off monuments (including tiny monuments such as surfaces of caves and water wells).
- Compounds should be limited to 100 high external walls and gates (or equivalent) and must not take away from gameplay, otherwise they will be reduced in size or removed.
- External TCs should only be used for securing building privilege <u>around compounds<u>. They should not be used to claim land. You must place compound walls down first before placing TCs.
- External TCs, deployables, and walls around decayed bases may be removed by an admin. 
- Buildings or building blocks that are used to claim land or that are blocking building privilege may be removed at admin discretion without prior warning.

#### Traps and Deployables:
- Traps should not hit anyone outside a base or compound (this includes peacekeepers as a passing player could be marked hostile). Traps that do not follow this may be temporarily adjusted to mitigate harm. Trap bases are not allowed.
- Player controlled drones may be flown at the owner's risk and others will not be held responsible for recovery.
- If server performance or gameplay issues arise due to deployables (ex. picture frames, wind turbines , lights, planter boxes, sprinklers, etc.) you may be asked to adjust or remove them.

#### Miscellaneous Information:
- Tool cupboards will stack building materials (wood, stone, metal fragments, and high quality metal) up to stacks of 50,000.
- You may ask a staff member to trade 4 wind turbines for a test generator.

<hr color="#22ffcd">


## Raiding and Looting Rules

#### General:
- Offline raiding is not allowed. Online raiding is not allowed unless agreed upon by both parties for an RP or event purpose.
- Sleepers cannot be killed or looted for 20 minutes after a server restart, server crash, or mass disconnects only.
    - Please be mindful that a player may have crashed. If a player crashes and reconnects within a reasonable amount of time, an admin may try to coordinate to see if items can be returned. 
    - If your game crashes, please create a ticket as soon as possible to let us know. 
    - Saving a disconnected player’s items for some time and letting an admin know is always appreciated.

#### Non-Decaying Bases:
- **You are responsible for securing your loot before logging off.**
    - **Twig blocks should not be destroyed.**
    - Twig is not considered a secure building material and therefore **loot stored behind twig** or **in unsecure areas of a base** will not be returned. 
    - This rule is not meant to encourage stealing, but rather to encourage securing loot.

- **<u>Secure Loot:</u>**
    - **Locked boxes within building privilege should not be destroyed.**
    - **Compounds are considered secure.**
        - Unlocked storage, locked storage, and deployables within secure areas of a base or compound cannot be looted. 
    - If you are caught looting a non-decaying base, you may be asked to leave or killed.
    - Legacy shelters will be considered building blocks, not deployables, and therefore should not be broken. They should be allowed to fully decay before the contents can be looted.
    - If you are caught looting a secure deployable you may be warned and then killed by the owner.

- **<u>Unsecure Loot:</u>**
    - Unsecure deployables refer to items within building privilege that are either unlocked or cannot be locked and that are that are accessible without boosting, placing twig, flying, etc.
    - Unsecure deployables may be looted.
        - If you are caught looting an unsecure deployable within building privilege, you may be asked to leave or killed.
        - If you find a base that has had a clear attempt to secure loot but certain areas remain vulnerable (ex. box placed in front of window bars), you may reach out to an admin to help secure it.
    - Boxes outside of building privilege are not considered secure and may be destroyed.

- **Conduct:**
    - If you are asked to leave someone's building you must do so. If a player refuses to leave after first attempting to seek a peaceful resolution, please open a ticket explaining the situation before taking defensive action (including killing the trespassers).
        - Please refrain from keeping items from killed trespassers. Notify an admin to help coordinate and facilitate return.
    - Twig and ladders should not be placed on another player’s base and boosting, flying, parachuting, etc. should not be used to gain access to another player’s base. 
    - If you gain access to an unlocked tool cupboard (TC), you may not grief the base (ex. authorizing TC and building to close it off or taking items).
        - If you find a non-decaying base left open or a base that looks like it has been raided, please do not loot it. **Please reach out to an admin to help secure it.** Any items that were lost between the time a base was left open and the time an admin closed or secure it will not be returned. We advise locks be placed on deployables since **locked boxes within building privilege should not be destroyed.** Players that continue to loot non-decaying bases instead of reporting to an admin will be disciplined accordingly.

#### Decaying Bases:

- **What is considered a decaying base?**
    - If a base is decaying, all building blocks made of the same material will experience decay. While some blocks may decay at different rates, the overall rule is that if a base is <u>actively</u> decaying, all building blocks composed of the same material will not be at full health. 
    - You can check the current health of a building block with a hammer. If you are unsure if a base is actively decaying or if it may look to have been raided, please reach out to an admin.
    - Bases made up of only foundations will be subject to decaying base rules since there would be no way to differentiate them from a non-decaying base.

- **Looting:**
    - Decaying bases **cannot be raided** (ex. breaking tool cupboards, building blocks, doors, etc.) **or griefed** (ex. closing off by authorizing on TC and building walls).
    - Decaying bases can be looted and locked boxes can be broken. Twig and ladders can be placed on decaying bases. 
    - If there a deployable that you cannot pick up or that is not lootable due to building privilege, you may repair the building block it is on until the building block the TC is on decays.
    - If the base owner returns to their decaying base, looters may be asked to leave to secure the base.
    - Decaying bases are not PVP zones.

#### Killed Players:
- Players killed outside of a PVP zone are not lootable but are responsible for getting back to their own body.
- Backpacks should not be looted or picked up outside of a PVP zone.
- Players who have hit the Patrol Helicopter and die to it are not lootable until the Patrol Helicopter is taken down.

## PVP / Monument Rules

#### General:
- PVP has been designated to specific areas of the map.
- Please see the table below for information regarding which monuments are PVP and which monuments are not.
- Specifics about certain monuments and temporary PVP zones are also outlined below.
- There is a max team size of 8 for PVP zones.
- Rocket PVP is only permitted if you are certain that your rockets you will not damage or hit another player's base. Remote PVP is not allowed.
- If you have died in PVP or for an RP reason, do not assume a teleport back from admins.
- You are not allowed to use RP or transportation to bait people into a PVP zone in order to kill them.
    - If you are killed after being invited to a PVP zone, this will not be considered baiting; you are entering at your own discretion.
- If you have any concerns regarding situations that may constitute baiting or questionable PVP behavior, please reach out via a Discord ticket instead of engaging in global chat.
    - We encourage players to report instances of rule violations or unsportsmanlike conduct to admins for resolution.
    - The community plays an important role in upholding fair play standards and maintaining a positive environment.
- **Final judgment on matters such as baiting and other PVP-related issues rests with the admins. Admins have the capability to monitor patterns of behavior and access a wealth of information to make informed decisions. Admins will also continue to monitor to ensure that concerns previously addressed with players are not recurring.**

#### PVP Rules:
- Players in PVP zones may not attack players outside of it and vice versa.
- If a fight breaks out in a non-temporary PVP zone, the fight can continue until both parties (on a per team member basis) leave the designated area.
- If you are killed or downed while the temporary PVP is active, your body can be looted by anyone, including yourself, after the temporary PVP is over. The looting of bodies after the PVP has ended should not be a PVP zone. **<u>If you do not want to participate in temporary PVP, stay inside and out of vision.</u>**
- Please be careful about entering a PVP zone (PVP monument or PRZ) with a tugboat or camper since all of the items inside would be at risk.

- **New Life Rule:**
    - Upon death to PVP, you are not allowed to visit the area where your body is for the next 10 minutes. Any loot you had is forfeit and is lootable by anyone. Do not go back for it.
    - If you die alone due to a PVE scenario within a PVP zone, you are allowed to return to your body to retrieve your belongings.
    - If you die to PVE in a PVP zone following a PVP engagement, the New Life Rule remains in effect for 10 minutes after the conclusion of PVP (as indicated by your combat log).
    - If you are killed in a PVP situation, you may not be invited back to continue the fight or to retrieve your items as other players may be present. If a player says they are leaving items for you to pick up after your 10-minute timer is up, they will not be held responsible for items that may be missing. If you have waited the 10-minute timer, return to your death location, and are killed again by the same player, this will not be considered baiting a PVP zone; you are reentering at your own discretion.
    - **The new life rule does not apply to the PRZ. It applies to temporary PVP (except Patrol Helicopter PVP) and all other PVP zones.**
    - If you die in a PVP zone outside of the PRZ you should not respawn in your camper or tugboat as this would be a violation of the new life rule.

#### PVP Boundaries: <a href="#PVP-Monuments"><sup>[^]</sup></a>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"></p> 

- **Monuments:**
    - The PVP area at the designated monuments is limited to terrain change or adjacent roads, whichever is closer.
    - The point where the PVP zone changes from being limited by a road to being limited by terrain change, the PVP zone extends directly from the apex of the road to the terrain change (see example below).

        - The Patrol Helicopter may be taken from anywhere on the map other than the MTC.
        - As this event draws players from all over the map, it's not feasible to set a specific limit on the PVP zone. While those uninterested in PVP should remain indoors and out of sight, participants are urged to exercise reasonable discretion in distinguishing between those actively countering and those not.
            - **Players who go outside during temporary PVP are doing so at their own risk and players engaging in PVP are not responsible for items lost as a result of this.**

    - <strong> <a href="#CargoShip">Cargo Ship:</a> <a href="#PVP-Monuments"><sup> [^]</sup></a>
        - The PVP zone around Cargo Ship extends to the maximum sniping distance from the Cargo Ship itself.
            - While kills within this range are acceptable, please try to exercise reasonable discretion when targeting players on the shore or in the water for other purposes.
            - Players not interested in PVP should remain vigilant of their surroundings when the Cargo Ship is present.
                - If you are at harbor when the Cargo Ship is appraoching and you do not want to participate in PVP, make sure to leave the area and stay out of sight.

<a name="PatrolHelicopter"></a>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

- <strong> <sup>†</sup>Patrol Helicopter: <a href="#PVP-Monuments"><sup> [^]</sup></a>
    - **Information:**
        - The Patrol Helicopter event is a global even that occurs every 2-4 hours.
        - To avoid being targeted by the Patrol Helicopter, players must be wearing two or less items of clothing (including backpack slot) and have no ranged weapons in their hot bar.
        - After the Patrol Helicopter has been destroyed, a debris field indicator will appear on the map. Please note that this indicator solely marks the crash site location. Its disappearance from the map does not signify the end of temporary PVP, nor is it associated with the crates being looted.
        - The four crates, unless dropped in the water, will be on fire and unlootable. After a few minutes, each crate will become lootable, with slight differences in the times each one is accessible.
    - **Gameplay:**
        - Automated server announcements will indicate the start and end of temporary PVP.
        - The temporary PVP zone begins when the destroyed Patrol Helicopter hits the ground. 
            - If the Patrol Helicopter is destroyed, falls near you, and you do not want to participate in PVP, either stay inside a building out of vision or stay away until all of the crates have been looted. **Players who go outside during temporary PVP are doing so at their own risk and players engaging in PVP are not responsible for items lost as a result of this.**
        - The temporary PVP zone ends when all of the crates have been looted.
        - If the crates land inside of a compound or on top of a base, anyone engaging in temporary PVP may climb, fly, ladder, etc., to gain access to the area where the crates are located. During this time, while temporary PVP is active, you may engage in PVP, loot dead bodies, and collect loot from the event crates only (not player-owned deployables). Once temporary PVP ends, you should leave the area that you had gained access to; you should not ladder into compounds or onto bases to collect loot from dead bodies after temporary PVP ends.
    - **Patrol Helicopter Takedown:**
        - Do not use another player’s base for protection from the Patrol Helicopter. 
        - Please try to be mindful about taking down Patrol Helicopter in populated areas. 
            - If Patrol Helicopter damages another player's base you are required to inform an admin to help seal and repair the base.
            - If you have not hit it and it falls and damages your base, please let an admin know and we can help you with repairs.
        - Players who have hit the Patrol Helicopter and die to it are not lootable until the Patrol Helicopter is taken down; you cannot kill other players who are actively trying to take the Patrol Helicopter down.
        - Please make use of the time between the Patrol Helicopter spawning (as indicated by both audio and visual cues) and its takedown to find a safe location if you prefer to avoid PVP encounters.
    - **Patrol Helicopter PVP:**
        - Your base may be used as cover by people in the area who are currently in PVP after the Patrol Helicopter has fallen.
        - <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The new life rule does not apply to Patrol Helicopter PVP.</p>
    - **Behavior:**
        - **Players are expected to prioritize obtaining loot from the crates as the primary objective, with PVP encounters naturally emerging as a product of the event.**
        - **Players should refrain from manipulating loot by leaving items, swapping items, or adding items to crates, as this behavior will be considered baiting.**
        - **Players should not avoid looting with the intention of baiting or prolonging PVP encounters.**
        - **Unfair or exploitative behavior may result in disciplinary measures.**
        - **Players are encouraged to report instances when these behavior rules are not followed. Patterns of behavior and questionable actions that are reported will be subject to judgment by admins. 

<a name="AirDrops"></a>
- <strong> <sup>†</sup>Airdrops: <a href="#PVP-Monuments"><sup> [^]</sup></a>
    - Airdrops are considered temporary PVP zones from the time they touch the ground until the time they are fully looted. If an airdrop has a parachute, it has not touched the ground. Since there is enough time before an airdrop touches the ground, check your surroundings, if an airdrop falls near you or you plan to loot one, be ready to engage in PVP.
    - If an airdrop recently falls near your base and you do not want to participate in PVP, stay inside and out of vision. If an airdrop falls on top of a base, anyone going for the airdrop can climb or ladder up to it once it has stopped moving.
    - <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Airdrops should not be used specifically to create or extended PVP zones.</p>

<a name="CargoShip"></a>
- <strong> <sup>†</sup>Cargo Ship: <a href="#PVP-Monuments"><sup> [^]</sup></a>
    - Cargo Ship PVP ends when the sirens signal that the ship is leaving.
    - If you do not want to participate in Cargo Ship PVP, stay out of vision.
    - <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The new life rule does not apply to Cargo Ship if you die within the PRZ.</p>

<a name="LockedCrates"></a>
- <strong> <sup>†</sup>Locked Crates: <a href="#PVP-Monuments"><sup> [^]</sup></a>
    - Locked crates can be dropped by Chinook at monuments which are normally PVP and monuments that are not normally PVP.

<a name="Transportation" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;"></a>

<hr color="#22ffcd">


## Transportation Rules

#### General:
- You may store and use unlocked modes of transportation. Unlocked modes of transportation can be claimed by another player if <u>completely</u> unattended. (The majority of the time owners are nearby, so please use reasonable discretion and ask in game and in chat if anyone is nearby before taking unattended transportation. This rule is not meant to encourage stealing. If you are caught stealing you may be asked to leave or killed). Vehicles must be stored in a secure location while offline. 
- You should not shoot at people in vehicles within non-PVP zones.
- If you die with any form of transportation in a temporary or permanent PVP zone, it may be taken. If you obtain a vehicle in PVP, please remember to remove existing locks, clear auth, and add a new lock.
- Please create a ticket if your mode of transportation is not recoverable (vehicles that are stuck and cannot be moved by any other player).

#### Modular Cars, Minicopters, Scrap Transport Helicopters, Player Attack Helicopters, Submarines, Horses, Hot Air Balloons, Rowboats, RHIBs, Snowmobiles, Trains:
- Locked modular cars can be left unattended, and therefore should not be damaged or have existing locks removed by other players. Do not leave your car on a powered car lift as this will not be considered secure.
- You may not steal or kill horses owned by or led by another player. 
- Trains are considered public and cannot be owned. Trains may enter PVP areas so passengers should be aware of their surroundings. Trains may only be temporarily claimed when actively utilized.
- Vehicle weapons should only be used to target other players within PVP zones.
- You are responsible for securing guns and ammo placed in your player attack helicopter **at all times**. This rule is not meant to encourage stealing, but rather to encourage securing your loot. Items may not be returned if misplaced or stolen. 

#### Tugboats and Campers:
- Tugboats and campers located in the PVP Zones can be broken into and looted (explosives can be used).
- Vehicles should not be moved into PVP zones by anyone other than the owners.
- **Please be careful about entering a PVP zone (PVP monument or PRZ) with a tugboat or camper since all of the items inside would be at risk.**
- Items lost due to decay will not be returned.
- Tugboats:
    - Loot and deployables placed in locked areas of a tugboat are considered secure. Deployables placed in unsecure areas of a tugboat follow the same rules as unsecure deployables. Locked boxes on the deck of a tugboat are considered secure.
    - Tugboats are considered owned if all 3 doors are locked by the same player or team.
    - If you die in a PVP zone outside of the PRZ you should not respawn in your camper or tugboat as this would be a violation of the new life rule.
    - Commandeering in PVP Zone:
        - While commandeering a tugboat in a PVP zone, the bottom floor door must be broken first and all respawn points on the tugboat must be cleared. You may then break into one or both of the doors on the helm (where the driving controls are) and clear authorization on the boat. The third door may be broken after driving the boat outside of PVP (the previous owners should not interfere with the removal of this door).
        - A tugboat is not considered secure while being commandeered if all 3 locks do not belong to the same player or team.
        - Players may use explosives to raid the doors on the tugboat.

<hr color="#22ffcd">


## Method Town Center Rules

The Method Town Center (**MTC**) will be a hub for fostering interactive gameplay, aiming to create a rich and interactive setting that accommodates a wide range of role-playing experiences. To ensure a positive and immersive atmosphere, it's crucial to establish clear rules and guidelines regarding player interactions within the MTC.

#### Protection from PVP and Temporary PVP:

<a name="Purge" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;"></a>

<hr color="#22ffcd">


## Purge Rules

The Purge is a PVP event for the end of the wipe in which everyone can experience vanilla style PVP and raiding with minimal liability as the server wipes the following day. With this in mind, **enjoy the gameplay but please always be respectful to each other**. While general banter is acceptable, excessive toxicity is not. Please remember at the end of the day, the community you are PVPing with is the same community that you will be interacting with in the future.

#### May 2024 Faction Wars:
- The Faction Wars will be a mid-wipe purge **only** for the PRZ that will take place between 5/18/2024 @ 12 PM Eastern until 5/18/2024 @ 5 PM Eastern.
- Keep an eye on the Discord for more details!

#### Gameplay:
- The purge is a two day event. The first day will be a PVP only event that begins on the Tuesday before wipe at 7 PM eastern. The second day of purge will be vanilla gameplay and will begin the Wednesday before wipe at 7 PM Eastern.
    - Vanilla gameplay does not mean our server values do not hold true. **<u>Be respectful to each other.</u>** Excessive toxicity may result in various consequences such as a mute or ban.
- There is a max roam / raiding size of 4 members per team (**as indicated by team UI**) at once. This 4-member limit does not apply to players defending their base.
    - Team UI changes will be monitored closely and deliberate attempts to circumvent this may result in exclusion from further participation in the ongoing or future purge events.
- No working with other groups during PVP / raiding.
    - This includes but is not limited to: providing information to another team, providing weapons and/or explosives to another team, and assisting another team with PVP.
- Neutrality is allowed but alliances are not (at no point should neutrality be an alliance to achieve a common goal).
- Players from other teams may spectate a raid at their own risk, but should refrain from creating an unfair advantage for any other team (ex. calling out hidden players). Please observe from a safe distance to avoid any potential misunderstandings regrading teaming.

#### Teams:
- Teammates may be benched in and out mid-raid, but there should never be more than 4 members of the same team active at the same raid target at the same time. 
    - Teammates waiting to be **swapped <u>in</u>** must not go to or respawn at the site of an active raid until the teammate being **swapped <u>out</u>** has respawned outside of the active raid.
    - For respawn points at site of active raid, if the teammate being **swapped <u>in</u>** has already respawned at the active raid before the teammate being **swapped <u>out</u>** has left the raid, they should not leave the respawn point.
        - *Note: This includes respawn points within a raid base.*
        - Raid bases are intended for use during active raids and therefore follow the same roaming / raiding team size limitations.
        - Members of the defending team may use explosives on a raid base as long as they are doing so from within the base they are defending.
            - <p style="margin-bottom: -24px;">If members of the defending team are outside of the base / compound they are defending, only 4 players may roam / raid together (ex. use explosives on the raid base). The same roaming / raiding team size limitations apply in this case.</p>

#### Conduct:
- If you suspect someone of breaking any rules, instead of broadcasting in chat, please create a ticket through discord and let us know.
    - Excessive banter concerning the discussion of rules in global chat, rather than creating a ticket, may result in a temporary mute with guidance to address disputes through the ticket system.
- Admins cannot be everywhere at once so please let all of us know if anything is happening by using the [⁠📩│tickets](https://discord.com/channels/809936105101066352/809944459793530880/810937523517128715) system on the discord.
    - While not a requirement, we encourage players provide us with as much information as possible. Providing combat logs, timestamps, screenshots, recordings, etc. may assist in resolving disputes quickly and effectively. 


<a name="Admin" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;"></a>

<hr color="#22ffcd">


## Admin Rules
#### General:
- Players can reach out to admins by creating a discord ticket or reaching out to us in game. For requests which do not require immediate attention, please feel free to post in the support channel. Admin response is only guaranteed via discord ticket. Allow up to 24 hours for pending tickets.
- Please respect that, as a principal, we try to inform players, give them the chance to correct their actions and have a discussion with all parties involved before taking action. Give people the chance to learn and move forward without conflict.
    - Please note we will always prioritize issues pertaining to the behavior rules before attending to other matters. Be aware that not all information is made public, but rest assured we will be doing our due diligence to address concerns.
    - Please try to avoid spamming chat asking for admin assistance. We will get to you when we can. Feel free to call out again if it has been some time.
- Issues that come up as a result of loopholes or lack of clarification in the rules will be addressed and decided by the admin team and adjusted accordingly.
- Interpretation and final verdict are at admin discretion. Everything is reviewed on a case-by-case basis and the rules stated here are to cover the basics.

#### Conduct:
- Complaints about staff may be emailed to [methodgamesrust@gmail.com](methodgamesrust@gmail.com) and will be addressed with the staff member and the rest of the staff team. 
- Admins may act as mediators between players and teams but admins will not enforce the terms of any agreements that fall outside of the rules. Such agreements do not allow any violation of the rules.
- In certain situations, such as removal of a team member, admins may attempt to facilitate conversation and compromise between players, but the terms should come from the players.
- Toxicity and disrespect toward staff will not be tolerated including refusal to comply in regards to server matters. Constructive criticism is welcome.

#### Building and Admin Spawning:
- At any time, you may reach out to an admin to either <u>trade your building resources for admin stacks or trade 4 of your wind turbines (not just the materials) for a test generator.</u>
- If there is a service you would like help with, we encourage you to first reach out to other players. Please do not ask admins for free items.
- If you have made progress with an RP building and you are in need of something you cannot normally get by crafting or looting, you may reach out to an admin for assistance. These items will be removed before the purge event.
- Items spawned by admins are to be utilized strictly for the purposes for which they were originally intended. Any use of these items beyond the scope or reason for which they were spawned will lead to immediate removal (despawning) of the items. Furthermore, the player in possession of these items may lose the ability to receive such admin-spawned items in future instances. This rule is enforced to maintain fair gameplay and uphold the integrity of the community.
- Items spawned in for an admin sponsored event should not be taken. If admin spawned items are found, reach out via a ticket to ensure the return of these items. If spawned in items are taken from an admin, they will be recovered and despawned accordingly. 

#### Teleporting:
- Admins may teleport you to an event but you are not guaranteed a teleport back. If you are asked to not bring items, you are not guaranteed storage or recovery if lost.
- If you are killed by a safe zone (outpost / bandit camp / fishing village / barn / ranch) and would like help retrieving your items, feel free to reach out to us to help you.

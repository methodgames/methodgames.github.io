- Harassment, doxxing, abuse, slander, hate speech, or discriminatory speech will not be tolerated.
- Racial stereotypes, sexual violence, domestic abuse, suicide, school shootings, slavery, etc. are considered inappropriate and RP, chat, comments, notes, jokes, graffiti, usernames, etc. that are disrespectful or that are about these are prohibited. 
- Actions taken to expressly deny other players the ability to enjoy the community or gameplay are not allowed (including bullying, stream sniping, and insiding).
- Any player caught harassing or bullying another player on the server or outside of the server, but in relation to their presence on the server will be removed or dealt with accordingly.
- Please be mindful that everyone is allowed to focus on aspects of gameplay they enjoy. Your ideas or interests may not coincide, but please be respectful.
- Respect the roleplay and respect those who are not currently looking for an interaction.
- Know your audience. RP, chat, actions, etc. should not make others uncomfortable. If someone is saying or doing something that makes you uncomfortable, please ask them to stop or ask them to avoid that type of interaction with you and let an admin know.
- No inappropriate usernames or profile pictures. Usernames referring to sexual acts and genitalia are not allowed. No websites in usernames. Chat and usernames must be in English characters.

- Excessive toxicity towards players and/or staff will not be tolerated and will result in a mute, kick, or ban determined by staff without warning. Discord tickets should be used to communicate behavioral issues. Keep us informed. Behavioral issues will be discussed with all parties involved. Behavior that continues to drive people (players or staff) from the community will result in a mute, kick, or ban as determined by the staff team.

## **General Rules**

- No killing on sight (KOS), random death match (RDM), or griefing (ex. placing traps, authorizing on a TC to deny access, building with the intention of building blocking, etc.)
- No roleplaying (RP) as a killer, thief, bounty hunter, etc. and no using RP or creating temporary PVP zones as a cover or excuse for killing people.
- <ins>If you have a disagreement with another player, please try to roleplay to a solution or respectfully come to a resolution before resorting to a ticket.</ins>
- If you are asked to leave someone’s property, please respect their request without hard feelings. Someone may ask you to leave if they are not currently looking to RP.
- Please do not hesitate to contact a staff member regarding any concerns or assistance.
- Please create a ticket If your items are not recoverable due to misconduct of another player.
- If you are ever in an uncomfortable situation or fear your items being lost, please take a clip or screenshot of your inventory and/or players in question to make recovery easier.
- Any instance where a loophole in gameplay or in the rules is being exploited will be handled by an admin decision.
- You will not be allowed to play if you have any accounts with a rust game ban in the last 180 days or >1 rust game ban.
- Use of third-party applications (using the Rust+ protocol) on the server relating to PVP timers or locations are not allowed and will result in an automatic temporary ban for 15 minutes.

**This wipe, there will be a designated PVP and raid zone (which will be referred to as PRZ below), as designated by the yellow outline below.** If your TC authorization range extends into the PRZ, your base will be considered within the PRZ and are subject to PRZ rules. There should be no question of whether your base is on the border of the PRZ.

## **Building Rules**

- You may ask a staff member to trade ***4*** wind turbines for a test generator.
- You may not wall off monuments (including tiny monuments such as surfaces of caves and water wells). Compounds should be limited to 100 high external walls and gates (or equivalent) and must not take away from gameplay, otherwise they will be reduced in size or removed.
- External TCs should only be used for securing building privilege <ins>around compounds</ins>. They should not be used to claim land. You must place compound walls down first.
- Traps should not hit anyone outside a base or compound. Trap bases are not allowed.
- External TCs, deployables, and walls around decayed bases may be removed by an admin.
- If server performance or gameplay issues arise due to deployables (ex. picture frames, wind turbines , lights, planter boxes, sprinklers, etc.) you may be asked to adjust or remove them.

## **Raiding and Looting Rules**

- Offline raiding is not allowed. Online raiding is not allowed unless agreed upon by both parties for an RP or event purpose.
- Sleepers cannot be killed or looted for <code>20<code> minutes after a server restart only. Please be mindful that a player may have crashed. If a player crashes and reconnects within a reasonable amount of time, an admin may try to coordinate to see if items can be returned. Please create a ticket as soon as possible to let us know. Saving the player’s items for some time and letting an admin know is appreciated.
- Non-decaying bases:
    - **Twig blocks should not be destroyed.** Twig is not considered a secure building material and loot stored behind twig or ***in unsecured areas of a base*** will not be returned. You are responsible for securing your loot before logging off. This rule is not meant to encourage stealing.
    - Compounds are considered secure. Unlocked storage, locked storage, and deployables within secure areas of a base or compound cannot be looted. If you are caught looting a non-decaying base, you may be asked to leave or killed.
    - Unsecure deployables (ex. large furnaces) may be looted and boxes outside of building privilege may be destroyed. If you are caught looting a deployable you may be warned and then killed by the owner. If you are asked to leave you must do so.
    - Twig and ladders should not be placed on another player’s base and boosting, flying, etc. should not be used to gain access to another player’s base. 
    - If you gain access to an unlocked tool cupboard (TC), you may not grief or the base (ex. authorizing TC and building to close it off or taking items).
        - If you find a non-decaying base left open or a base that looks like it has been raided, please reach out to an admin to help secure it.
